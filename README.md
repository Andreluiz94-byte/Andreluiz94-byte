**A brief summary** ðŸ‘‰
I started by learning frontend development, focusing on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. As I progressed, I became interested in backend development. I explored languages like Python, Java, C#, PHP and frameworks like Node.js.

Now, I want to become a full stack developer. I aim to combine my frontend and backend skills to create complete web applications. My goal is to work proficiently across the entire development stack, and I'm committed to acquiring the necessary skills to achieve that.
